This is the downloads page for Isaac Berman's porfolio, updated Mar 2020. All playable downloads except the 3D rendering are built for 64-bit Windows and should function as-is. Note that experiences for VR will need the proper VR headset for the proper experience.

3D rendering is provided as C source code and a supplementary Java program for polygon mesh generation. It will need to be compiled separately. Note that it requires libraries for math (-lm), multi-threading (-lpthread), and X11(-lX11). It also requires an active X11 server running on the computer, so will likely not function on Windows or OSX devices. See screenshots attached.
